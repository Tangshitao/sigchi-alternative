==================

LaTeX document style for ACM SIGCHI conferences. 

Adapted from sigchi class previously edited by:
   Michel Beaudouin-Lafon (CHI 2013)

Sigchi class adapted from ARTICLE document style by Ken Traub, Olin Shivers.
Excerpts were taken from (Journal Style) 'esub2acm.cls'

The new class sigchi-alternative makes extensive use of preexisting packages.
LaTeX commands are used instead of TeX commands and all code has been grouped and formated more consistently.
