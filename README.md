==================

LaTeX document style for ACM SIGCHI conferences. 

Adapted from sigchi class previously edited by:
*  Michel Beaudouin-Lafon (CHI 2013)
*  William Hudson         (CHI 2012)
*  Jean-Daniel Fekete     (CHI 2012)

Sigchi class adapted from ARTICLE document style by Ken Traub, Olin Shivers.
Excerpts were taken from (Journal Style) 'esub2acm.cls'

For format specification see http://sheridanprinting.com/sigchi/chi.htm (CHI) and http://sheridanprinting.com/sigchi/uist.htm (UIST).

The new class sigchi-alternative makes extensive use of preexisting packages.
LaTeX commands are used instead of TeX commands and all code has been grouped and formated more consistently.
